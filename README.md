Write a complete C++ program that fulfills the following requirements:
1. Allow the user to input a number of bits to represent a base 10 integer (in the
Excess M system).
2. Input the base 10 integer. Use a loop that will continue to input numbers until the
user inputs an integer that is in range (based on the number of bits).
3. Compute and output the equivalent Excess M binary number to the console
screen.
4. Continue to run the program until the user decides that he wants to quit. The
user should be allowed to make an indefinite number of conversions.
